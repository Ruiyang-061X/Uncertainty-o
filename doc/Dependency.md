# Dependency

You need to follow the instruction in [AnyGPT](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/AnyGPT), [OneLLM](https://github.com/csuhan/OneLLM), [InternVL](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL), [RGB2point](https://github.com/JaeLee18/RGB2point) to install their environments, since they are currently not directly supported by HuggingFace.


The source code of those repos should be cloned and put in th dependency/ folder like:
```
├── dependency/
│   ├── AnyGPT/
│   ├── OneLLM/
│   ├── PointLLM/
│   ├── RGB2point/
```
